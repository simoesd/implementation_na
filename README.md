This repository contains all the source code for my thesis "Implementation and Evaluation of Neuroevolution Algorithms".
This includes the neural network architecture, algorthms, problems, GUI, data processing tools and other miscellanous aspects needed for the project.


# User Manual
For the purpose of demonstrating the work developed in this thesis, a simple graphical user interface was built.

When opening the program, a page with a variety of options is shown. These include:
 - **General Parameters:** Parameters required for all experiments implemented. This includes the shape of the neural network, a resolution parameter used for discretization and from which the maximum generation is set, the number of times the selected experiment should be ran, and the optimum at which an execution is considered a success. If desired, the user can also export the results into a Comma Separated Value file;
 - **Problem Parameters:** Parameters respective to the problem to be tested. The user should select what problem using the dropdown menu. When relevant for the chosen problem, other fields will be enabled (e.g. number of points for the Discrete Hyper-sphere Problems);
  - **Algorithm Parameters:** Parameters respective to the algorithm to be tests. Once again, the user can select the algorithm to use through the dropdown menu. If required, other fields will be enabled, allowing customization of parameters like Self-Adaptation parameters.

Once all the desired variables are set, simply click the "Run Experiments" button. As each iteration is finished, its results will be displayed in the text box at the bottom.
If an export file is set, these results will also be exported for further analysis.

A python script can be found in the dataAnalysis folder. This scripts takes in one argument, the input file, and generates a second file including medians and significance tests.
When running this script with a file generated by the GUI, very few data will be produced (only a single row of median values and no significance test).

This is because the GUI allows you to ran many iterations of the same problem+algorithms parameters, while the analysis made is meant to compare different environments.
Simply exports results with different parameters in the GUI, combine them into a single file and the python script will allow you to quickly process them all at once.
